## About Me

I am a East Asia Core Observatory Association ([EACOA](https://www.eacoa.net/)) [Fellow](https://www.eacoa.net/fellowship.php) working at Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics ([ASIAA](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/)) in Taiwan. I am a member of the Event Horizon Telescope ([EHT](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/)) collaboration.

I study supermassive black holes and relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN), particularly in the nearby giant radio galaxy M87. I use very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) techniques to study how the jets are launched, collimated, and accelerated to relativistic speeds. I am also interested in calibration and imaging of VLBI data. I have developed a novel calibration pipeline [GPCAL]{https://jhparkastro.github.io/software/} for removing artificially generated signals in VLBI data. Based on this expertise, I have made a significant contribution to the [first linear polarization image of a black hole]{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910L..12E/abstract} released by the EHT collaboration in March 2021. My current research interests are focused on (i) [developing calibration tools for VLBI data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...85P/abstract), (ii) [revealing the magnetic field structure in AGN jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...871..257P/abstract), and (iii) [understanding the collimation and acceleration processes in AGN jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...76P/abstract).

I was born in Seoul, Republic of Korea. I received a B.S. in Astronomy from Seoul National University (SNU) in 2013. I continued to study and earned a Ph.D. in Astronomy from SNU in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Sascha Trippe](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~trippe/). I started to work at my current institution [ASIAA](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2019, and as a EACOA fellow in 2020.
