## About Me

# I am an assistant professor at the Department of Astronomy and Space Science at Kyung Hee University ([KHU](https://space.khu.ac.kr/space/user/main/view.do)). Before I move to KHU, I worked at Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute ([KASI](https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index)) and at Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics ([ASIAA](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/)) in Taiwan. I am a member of the Event Horizon Telescope ([EHT](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/)) collaboration.

I am currently an assistant professor at the Department of Astronomy and Space Science at Kyung Hee University ([KHU](https://space.khu.ac.kr/space/user/main/view.do)). Prior to joining KHU, I held positions at the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute ([KASI](https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index)) and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics ([ASIAA](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/)) in Taiwan. Additionally, I am an active member of the Event Horizon Telescope ([EHT](https://eventhorizontelescope.org/)) collaboration.

# I study supermassive black holes and relativistic jets in active galactic nuclei (AGN), particularly in the nearby giant radio galaxy M87. I use very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) techniques to study how the jets are launched, collimated, and accelerated to relativistic speeds. I am also interested in calibration and imaging of VLBI data. I have developed a novel calibration pipeline [GPCAL](https://jhparkastro.github.io/software/) for removing artificially generated signals in VLBI data. Based on this expertise, I have made a significant contribution to the [first polarized image around a black hole](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910L..12E/abstract) released by the EHT collaboration in March 2021. My current research interests are focused on (i) [developing calibration tools for VLBI data](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...85P/abstract), (ii) [revealing the magnetic field structure in AGN jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...871..257P/abstract), and (iii) [understanding the collimation and acceleration processes in AGN jets](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...76P/abstract).

I specialize in the study of supermassive black holes and relativistic jets within active galactic nuclei (AGN), with a particular focus on the nearby giant radio galaxy M87. My research involves the application of very long baseline interferometric (VLBI) techniques to investigate the mechanisms responsible for launching, collimating, and accelerating these jets to relativistic speeds. Additionally, I am deeply engaged in the calibration and imaging of VLBI data and have developed a novel calibration pipeline known as [GPCAL](https://jhparkastro.github.io/software/) designed to eliminate artificially generated signals in VLBI data. Leveraging this expertise, I made a significant contribution to the [first polarized image captured around a black hole](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910L..12E/abstract), which was released by the EHT collaboration in March 2021.

My current research endeavors revolve around three main areas of interest:

(i) Developing calibration tools tailored for VLBI data [(link)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...906...85P/abstract),
(ii) Unveiling the magnetic field structure within AGN jets. [(link)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...871..257P/abstract),
(iii) Enhancing our understanding of the processes involved in collimating and accelerating jets within AGN [(link)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...76P/abstract).

# I was born in Seoul, Republic of Korea. I received a B.S. in Astronomy from Seoul National University (SNU) in 2013. I continued to study and earned a Ph.D. in Astronomy from SNU in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Sascha Trippe](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~trippe/). I worked at [ASIAA](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2019, and as a EACOA fellow in 2020-2022. I worked for the Greenland Telescope ([GLT](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/project/vlbi.php)) project together with Dr. [Keiichi Asada](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=asada) and Dr. [Masanori Nakamura](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=jpark). I started working at [KASI](https://www.kasi.re.kr/eng/index) since 2022. My current main research interest is studying AGN jets and supermassive black holes using global millimeter VLBI arrays such as the EHT and [GMVA](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/vlbi/globalmm/).

I was born in Seoul, Republic of Korea, and completed my undergraduate education at Seoul National University (SNU), where I received a B.S. in Astronomy in 2013. My academic journey continued at SNU, leading to the successful completion of my Ph.D. in Astronomy in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Sascha Trippe](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~trippe/). Subsequently, I pursued a career in research, commencing as a postdoctoral fellow at [ASIAA](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/) in 2019, followed by a position as an EACOA fellow from 2020 to 2022. During this period, I was actively involved in the Greenland Telescope ([GLT](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/project/vlbi.php)) project, collaborating closely with Dr. [Keiichi Asada](http://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=asada) and Dr. [Masanori Nakamura](https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv.php?i=nakamura). In 2022, I achieved tenure as a scientist at KASI and have been a member of the KHU faculty since 2023. Currently, my primary research focus revolves around the study of AGN jets and supermassive black holes, with a specific emphasis on utilizing global millimeter VLBI arrays such as the EHT and [GMVA](https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/div/vlbi/globalmm/).

I am delighted to share some photos from the EHT M87 polarization press conference that took place at ASIAA in Taiwan, where I had the privilege of being the main speaker. As a scientist, it was an exhilarating experience being in the spotlight alongside numerous members of the media.
